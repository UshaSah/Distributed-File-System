## Error Category 1: C++ Standard Library Installation Issues

### Error #1: Missing C++ Headers
**Error Message:**
```bash
test_simple.cpp:1:10: fatal error: 'iostream' file not found
    1 | #include <iostream>
      |          ^~~~~~~~~~
```

**Root Cause:**
- Apple's Command Line Tools had incomplete C++ standard library installation
- Missing core headers like `<iostream>`, `<cstdint>`, `<vector>`, `<chrono>`
- SDK version mismatches between compiler and available headers

**Debugging Process:**
1. Verified compiler installation: `clang++ --version` ✅
2. Checked include paths: `clang++ -v -E -x c++ - < /dev/null`
3. Found headers in wrong SDK versions: `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX15.2.sdk/usr/include/c++/v1/iostream`
4. Attempted manual SDK specification: `clang++ -isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX14.5.sdk` ❌

**Solution:**
```bash
# Installed complete C++ toolchain via Homebrew
brew install gcc
# Used Homebrew GCC instead of system clang++
g++-15 -std=c++17 test.cpp -o test  # ✅ Success
```

**Interview Takeaway:** 
- Always verify complete toolchain installation for complex C++ projects
- macOS Command Line Tools alone insufficient for full C++ development
- Homebrew provides more complete, properly configured toolchains

## Error Category 2: CMake Configuration Issues

### Error #2: CMake Dependency Download Failures
**Error Message:**
```bash
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:66 (message):
  Failed to download cpp-httplib
```

**Root Cause:**
- CMakeLists.txt configured to download external dependencies
- Network issues or dependency conflicts
- Overly complex build configuration for initial development

**Solution:**
- Created simplified CMakeLists.txt focusing on core components
- Removed external dependencies for initial development phase
- Used system compiler detection instead of forced downloads

**Interview Takeaway:**
- Start with minimal viable build configuration
- Add complexity incrementally
- Always have fallback build options

## Error Category 3: Header/Implementation Mismatches

### Error #3: Missing Standard Library Includes
**Error Message:**
```bash
/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/15.1.0/include/c++/15/bits/c++io.h:52:11: error: 'FILE' does not name a type
 52 |   typedef FILE __c_file;
      |           ^~~~
```

**Root Cause:**
- Missing `#include <cstdio>` in header files
- Chain of missing includes causing cascading failures
- Template instantiation failures due to incomplete type definitions

**Debugging Process:**
1. Identified missing FILE type definition
2. Traced back to missing `<cstdio>` include
3. Found multiple headers missing critical includes
4. Systematically added missing includes

**Solution:**
```cpp
// Added to affected header files:
#include <cstdio>        // For FILE* types
#include <stdexcept>     // For std::runtime_error  
#include <unordered_map> // For std::unordered_map
#include <thread>        // For std::this_thread::sleep_for
```

**Interview Takeaway:**
- Always include dependencies explicitly in headers
- Missing includes cause cascading compilation failures
- Modern C++ requires careful dependency management

### Error #4: Macro Conflicts
**Error Message:**
```bash
/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/15.1.0/include/c++/15/bits/c++io.h:52:11: error: 'FILE' does not name a type
/Users/mac/Desktop/Coding_projects/Distributed_file_system/include/utils/logger.h:25:9: error: expected identifier before numeric constant
   25 |         DEBUG = 0,
      |         ^~~~~
```

**Root Cause:**
- System headers defining `DEBUG` macro conflicting with enum values
- Macro expansion interfering with enum declarations
- Compiler treating `DEBUG` as preprocessor macro instead of enum value

**Debugging Process:**
1. Identified `DEBUG` macro conflict in system headers
2. Found enum values being treated as macros
3. Analyzed preprocessor output to confirm macro expansion

**Solution:**
```cpp
// Before (conflicting):
enum class Level {
    DEBUG = 0,    // ❌ Conflicts with system DEBUG macro
    INFO = 1,
    WARN = 2,
    ERROR = 3,
    CRITICAL = 4
};

// After (fixed):
enum class Level {
    LOG_DEBUG = 0,    // ✅ No conflicts
    LOG_INFO = 1,
    LOG_WARN = 2,
    LOG_ERROR = 3,
    LOG_CRITICAL = 4
};
```

**Interview Takeaway:**
- Avoid common macro names in user code
- Use descriptive, prefixed names for enums
- Check for macro conflicts when using system headers

## Error Category 4: Threading and Concurrency Issues

### Error #5: Mutex Const-Correctness
**Error Message:**
```bash
/Users/mac/Desktop/Coding_projects/Distributed_file_system/src/utils/retry_handler.cpp:262:38: error: binding reference of type 'std::lock_guard<std::mutex>::mutex_type&' {aka 'std::mutex&'} to 'const std::mutex' discards qualifiers
   262 |     std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(handlers_mutex_);
      |                                      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

**Root Cause:**
- Mutexes declared as non-mutable in classes
- Const methods trying to lock non-mutable mutexes
- C++ const-correctness rules preventing modification of const objects

**Debugging Process:**
1. Identified const method trying to lock mutex
2. Analyzed mutex declaration in class definition
3. Understood C++ const-correctness requirements

**Solution:**
```cpp
// Before (incorrect):
class RetryManager {
private:
    std::mutex handlers_mutex_;  // ❌ Not mutable
public:
    std::unordered_map<std::string, RetryHandler::RetryStats> get_all_stats() const {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(handlers_mutex_);  // ❌ Error
    }
};

// After (fixed):
class RetryManager {
private:
    mutable std::mutex handlers_mutex_;  // ✅ Mutable for const methods
public:
    std::unordered_map<std::string, RetryHandler::RetryStats> get_all_stats() const {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(handlers_mutex_);  // ✅ Works
    }
};
```

**Interview Takeaway:**
- Mutexes used in const methods must be declared `mutable`
- Understand C++ const-correctness deeply
- Thread-safety and const-correctness can conflict - `mutable` resolves this

## Error Category 5: Template and Hash Function Issues

### Error #6: Hash Function Template Instantiation
**Error Message:**
```bash
/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/15.1.0/include/c++/15/bits/hashtable.h:210:51: error: static assertion failed: hash function must be copy constructible
 210 |       static_assert(is_copy_constructible<_Hash>::value,
      |                                                   ^~~~~
```

**Root Cause:**
- `std::unordered_map` requiring copy-constructible hash functions
- Complex template instantiation with nested types
- GCC 15.1.0 stricter template requirements than older versions

**Debugging Process:**
1. Identified hash function requirements in unordered_map
2. Found template instantiation failing on nested types
3. Analyzed RetryStats structure for copy-constructibility issues

**Solution:**
- Simplified complex template instantiations
- Ensured all types used in unordered_map are properly copy-constructible
- Used simpler data structures where complex templates caused issues

**Interview Takeaway:**
- Modern C++ compilers have stricter template requirements
- Understand copy-constructibility requirements for STL containers
- Sometimes simpler solutions are better than complex templates

## Error Category 6: Build System Integration

### Error #7: CMake Compiler Detection
**Error Message:**
```bash
-- The CXX compiler identification is AppleClang 16.0.0.16000026
# But we wanted GCC 15.1.0
```

**Root Cause:**
- CMake auto-detecting wrong compiler
- Need to force specific compiler for consistency
- Compiler-specific optimizations and features

**Solution:**
```bash
# Force CMake to use specific compiler
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/g++-15 \
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/gcc-15 \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```

**Interview Takeaway:**
- Always specify exact toolchain versions for production builds
- CMake compiler detection can be unreliable
- Document exact build requirements

## Error Category 7: Logger Integration Issues

### Error #8: Circular Logger Dependencies
**Error Message:**
```bash
/Users/mac/Desktop/Coding_projects/Distributed_file_system/src/utils/retry_handler.cpp:30:5: error: 'get_instance' is not a member of 'dfs::utils::Logger'
   30 |     LOG_INFO("Creating RetryHandler...");
      |     ^~~~~~~~
```

**Root Cause:**
- Logger class not fully implemented when other classes tried to use it
- Circular dependency between utility classes
- Static method implementation missing

**Solution:**
- Temporarily replaced LOG_* macros with simple cout statements
- Implemented logger functionality incrementally
- Avoided circular dependencies in utility classes

**Interview Takeaway:**
- Implement core utilities before dependent classes
- Avoid circular dependencies in utility libraries
- Have fallback logging mechanisms during development

## Debugging Methodology & Best Practices

### 1. Systematic Error Analysis
```
1. Read error message carefully
2. Identify error category (compilation, linking, runtime)
3. Trace back to root cause
4. Apply targeted fix
5. Test incrementally
```

### 2. Incremental Development Approach
```
1. Start with minimal working example
2. Add complexity one component at a time
3. Test each addition thoroughly
4. Maintain working baseline at all times
```

### 3. Toolchain Verification
```
1. Verify compiler installation and version
2. Check include paths and library locations
3. Test with simple "Hello World" first
4. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
```

### 4. Header-First Development
```
1. Design interfaces first (header files)
2. Implement incrementally
3. Fix header/implementation mismatches immediately
4. Test compilation frequently during development
```
