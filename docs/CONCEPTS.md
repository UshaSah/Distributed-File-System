# Distributed File System - Concepts and Overview

## What is a Distributed File System?

A distributed file system (DFS) is a file system that allows multiple computers to access shared storage over a network. It provides a unified view of files and directories across multiple machines, enabling users to access files as if they were stored locally, regardless of their physical location.

### Key Characteristics

- **Transparency**: Users don't need to know where files are physically stored
- **Scalability**: Can handle large amounts of data and many users
- **Fault Tolerance**: Continues operating even when some components fail
- **Consistency**: Maintains data integrity across all nodes
- **Performance**: Optimized for high throughput and low latency

## Core Concepts

### 1. **File System Components**

#### **SuperBlock**
- The "header" of the file system containing essential metadata
- Stores information like block size, total blocks, free blocks, inode count
- Critical for file system initialization and validation
- Must be consistent and accessible for the file system to function

#### **Inode Table**
- Each file and directory has an inode (index node) containing metadata
- Stores file permissions, ownership, size, timestamps, and block pointers
- Enables fast file lookups and efficient storage management
- Supports concurrent access through proper locking mechanisms

#### **Block Manager**
- Manages the allocation and deallocation of data blocks
- Tracks which blocks are free and which are in use
- Implements strategies for block allocation (first-fit, best-fit, etc.)
- Ensures efficient space utilization and prevents fragmentation

### 2. **Concurrency and Threading**

#### **Multi-threading**
- Multiple threads can handle different requests simultaneously
- Thread pools manage worker threads efficiently
- Thread-safe operations prevent data corruption
- Enables high throughput and responsiveness

#### **Locking Mechanisms**
- **Reader-Writer Locks**: Allow multiple readers or single writer
- **Mutexes**: Protect critical sections from concurrent access
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Ordered locking to prevent circular waits
- **Lock-Free Structures**: Atomic operations for high-performance scenarios

#### **Atomic Operations**
- Operations that complete entirely or not at all
- Used for counters, flags, and simple data structures
- Eliminates the need for locks in certain scenarios
- Improves performance by reducing contention

### 3. **Transaction Management**

#### **ACID Properties**
- **Atomicity**: All operations in a transaction succeed or all fail
- **Consistency**: Database remains in a valid state after transaction
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other
- **Durability**: Committed changes persist even after system failure

#### **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**
- Changes are logged before being applied to the file system
- Enables recovery from system crashes
- Provides rollback capability for failed transactions
- Ensures data durability and consistency

#### **Transaction Isolation Levels**
- **Read Committed**: Default level, prevents dirty reads
- **Serializable**: Highest level, prevents all anomalies
- **Optimistic Concurrency**: Assumes conflicts are rare
- **Pessimistic Concurrency**: Locks resources to prevent conflicts

### 4. **Distributed Architecture**

#### **RESTful API**
- HTTP-based interface for file operations
- JSON format for data exchange
- Stateless design for scalability
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

#### **Load Balancing**
- Distributes requests across multiple server instances
- Improves performance and availability
- Handles server failures gracefully
- Supports horizontal scaling

#### **Replication**
- Data stored on multiple nodes for redundancy
- Improves availability and fault tolerance
- Maintains consistency across replicas
- Enables load distribution

### 5. **Error Handling and Resilience**

#### **Rate Limiting**
- Token bucket algorithm for request throttling
- Prevents system overload and abuse
- Configurable limits per client
- Supports burst capacity for traffic spikes

#### **Circuit Breaker**
- Fails fast when services are down
- Prevents cascading failures
- Automatic recovery when service is restored
- Three states: Closed, Open, Half-Open

#### **Retry Logic**
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Error classification (transient vs permanent)
- Configurable retry policies
- Prevents thundering herd problems

### 6. **Performance Optimization**

#### **Caching**
- **Inode Cache**: Frequently accessed file metadata
- **Block Cache**: Recently used data blocks
- **Metadata Cache**: Directory listings and file information
- **Write Cache**: Buffered writes for better performance

#### **Asynchronous Operations**
- Non-blocking I/O operations
- Async file operations for better concurrency
- Event-driven architecture
- Improved resource utilization

#### **Memory Management**
- Smart pointers for automatic memory management
- Memory pools for frequent allocations
- Cache-friendly data structures
- NUMA-aware memory allocation

## Technical Implementation

### **C++ Design Patterns**

#### **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**
```cpp
class FileHandle {
    std::string path_;
    std::mutex handle_mutex_;
public:
    FileHandle(const std::string& path) : path_(path) {}
    ~FileHandle() { close(); } // Automatic cleanup
};
```

#### **Smart Pointers**
```cpp
std::unique_ptr<FileSystem> file_system_;
std::shared_ptr<Inode> inode_;
```

#### **Template Programming**
```cpp
template<typename Func, typename... Args>
auto execute_with_retry(Func&& func, Args&&... args) 
    -> decltype(func(args...));
```

### **Concurrency Patterns**

#### **Thread Pool**
```cpp
class ThreadPool {
    std::vector<std::thread> workers_;
    std::queue<std::function<void()>> tasks_;
    std::mutex queue_mutex_;
    std::condition_variable condition_;
};
```

#### **Reader-Writer Locks**
```cpp
std::shared_mutex inode_mutex_;
void read_inode() { std::shared_lock lock(inode_mutex_); }
void write_inode() { std::unique_lock lock(inode_mutex_); }
```

### **Error Handling Patterns**

#### **Exception Hierarchy**
```cpp
class FileSystemException : public std::exception {};
class InodeNotFoundException : public FileSystemException {};
class InsufficientSpaceException : public FileSystemException {};
```

#### **Circuit Breaker**
```cpp
enum class CircuitState { CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN };
std::atomic<CircuitState> circuit_state_;
```
